    <h3>Hello there!</h3>
<p>These are my thoughts on trying to build a blog with the latest "cool" thing called GithubPages + Jekyll.</p>
<p>If you have never heard about it before, it's basically using "free" web hosting on
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GithubPages</a> plus a static website generator engine called
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>There are many great tutorials to get you started, one being an official
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">Jekyll Guide</a> which gives an overview of how to integrate
the two and a second one, the more <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">analytical</a> by
Jonathan McGlone.</p>
<p>However having Jekyll on its own does not really help with making a blog that
looks nice, especially if you're a developer like me who has no idea how to
design anything better than a napkin.</p>
<p>So what does anyone do when need something? Ask <del>our Supreme Overlord</del> Google
for a nice theme. The one I found that I really liked was <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a>. It's a
two column theme that was pretty much what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I just went ahead, and put everything together, trying to make it work. Usually
that's not the proper way to do something in a professional setting, however when
trying out a new project I think this is a better way to get a good understanding
of how different parts come together.</p>
<h3>How to do it wrong</h3>
<p>To dive right in I downloaded Jekyll and created a new site. Then begun the hard part.
How do I integrate Hyde? Hyde is itself built upon a set of foundation setup called
<a href="http://getpoole.com/">Poole</a>, however Hyde already contains all Poole code that is needed so
I decided to just head over to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde/">Hyde codebase</a> and try to copy all
code tha seemed relevant. After a bit of back and forth and deleting what I thought
was not needed/I didn't want on my blog I thought I was ready to go.</p>
<p>The major problem I encountered was that the blog would stubbornly not show any blog posts.</p>
<p>Turns out I was missing the paginate gem (Jekyll engine is based on ruby) and also
two necessary config items.</p>
<p>After a lot of search, and feedback from Google I managed to get it working.</p>
<p><strong>Note to self:</strong> Code on config files is usually necessay,
do not delete without checking the outcome.</p>
<p>The next challenge encountered was how to integrate a custom domain name. GithubPages
already provide the [username].github.io url for the page, where [username] is your
github one, however I always wanted a customer domain and now was the time to get it.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the basics of how domains work: you have a server that matches URLS to IPs
however how do you actually make assign one to the other?</p>
<p>A(ddress) and CNAME Records</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A">A-records</a> are basically mappings that return a 32-bit IPv4 address. They are used
by your domain registrar to let them know where you want the URL you just bought
though them to direct to.</p>
<p>In our case Github provides two IP addresses to map to. However how does Github know
which site (Github URL) to direct the request to?</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME</a> records. As described by wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Canonical Name record (abbreviated as CNAME record) is a type of resource record
in the Domain Name System (DNS) used to specify that a domain name is an alias for another domain,
the "canonical" domain. All information, including subdomains, IP addresses, etc.,
are defined by the canonical domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what we are basically doing with this file is map the external URL (in my case
tsaprailis.com) to the internal URL that Github knows kostistsaprailis.github.io.</p>
<h3>Is the hassle worth it?</h3>
<p>So enough with the rant, was it actually worth it?</p>
<p>That's not a straightfoward answer. There are currently far easier ways to start a blog
(Wordpress, Medium etc), why go through all the hassle to make it from scratch?</p>
<p>Well, what drew me to Jekyll is that as a developer I'm always
enjoying more building stuff myself. Having exposure to the underlying code is
always a great strength that allows you to configure (and also break) a project,
and also provide valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>So take something apart, break it and then try to make it work. You will always be
more motivated to make it work again. Go break stuff!</p>
