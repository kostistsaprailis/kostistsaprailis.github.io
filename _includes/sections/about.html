    Hi there!<br><br>
    My name is Konstantinos (Kostis) Tsaprailis.<br><br>
    I have graduated with an Electrical & Computer Engineer diploma by the <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html">National Technical University of Athens</a>.<br><br>
    I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer at <a href="https://mist.io/">Mist.io</a>.<br><br>    
    At night I'm moonlighting as a part time student in the Data Science Master's program of the <a href="http://www.aueb.gr/index_en.php">Athens University of Economics and Business</a>.<br><br>
